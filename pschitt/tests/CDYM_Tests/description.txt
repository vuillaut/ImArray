Griesen profile added to sky_objects.py allowing for random distribution of particles along Z axis with a distribution dependent on the initial energy and interaction height of the shower.

X and Y profiles set by random Gaussian distributions scaled such that on average 90% of particles reside within 1 Moliere Radius of the shower axis (at sea level).

If shower = pschitt.sky_objects.shower:
-> Simulation using Greisen Function activated with "shower.Greisen_Profile()"
-> New shower input parameters needed in run script:
--> "shower.energy_primary = number[eV]" : sets energy of the primary gamma-ray photon.
--> "shower.height_of_first_interaction = height[m]" : sets the height at which the initial photon interacts with the atmosphere.
--> "shower.scale = number[-]" : sets the resolution of the distribution function produced from the Greisen Function. A lower number corresponds to a higher number of simulated particles. (Recommended range: 1-100).

Inputs no longer needed in run script:
-> "shower.number_of_particles" : determined by primary energy.
-> "shower_top/length/width : determined by preprogrammed functions (see top of comment).
