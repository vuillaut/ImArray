Developments to be done:

- handle the different camera sizes

- object shape closer to a shower's one

- particles emitting in a cone = visible only if the telescope is this cone: compute this cone for each particle, determine if the telescope is in the cone (is_particle_visible)

- transmission coefficient in the air for each particle as a function of the distance to the telescope. first step: boolean, particle visible if transmission coefficient above a limit
